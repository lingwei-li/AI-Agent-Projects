Sure that they don't look state, right? Yeah, and I make sure that the information that I fill out on the E verify system is is just the same data that that you filled out on the i nine form. It's that simple. All right, so there was some excuse me. There was a few data fields that I needed from you, and you got those to me really quick. Thank you. And I did a bad job of reading your email, your initial email. You were asking me questions about the process, and I think I ignored that. I didn't do it on purpose. I just know, well, I knew after going through training, because after I going through that process of getting set up with the Verify system, it made me go through five different training classes, and then there was a test at the end. Oh, I passed. I got there was what was there. There was 37 questions, I think, and I got two wrong. Oh, anyways, I retained a lot of the information. It was really simple, but at this point, it's just a process of you and I making sure that actually this next form I believe, and you tell me wrong, but it's, it's, it's between us and your school. Is that right?

Unknown 1:27
Yeah, yeah, I just need to report this form to my school. And if we have some wrong, the school just will tell us and we can change. Okay, yeah,

I just opened your email. Yeah, I'm going to share my screen.

Unknown 7:41

Unknown 7:45

Unknown 7:50

Unknown 8:01

Unknown 8:05
I love chat GPT. Yeah, I, I, I always reference chat GPT as if it was a woman. Mm, hmm. So do you do the same? Uh, no, you just say chat GPT. Uh huh.

Unknown 8:24
Then it's my personal problem. Then,

Unknown 8:28
all right, let me see I

Unknown 8:43
yeah, this read really good.

Unknown 8:48
Okay, that one looks good, all right, so goals and objectives. I

Unknown 9:12
I'm not used to reading on such a well at 250%

Unknown 9:18
magnification. I

Unknown 9:26
Oh, yeah, that's that's well written employer oversight. I

Unknown 9:56
Hey, what? What's, what's this?

Unknown 10:00
Oh, sorry, what's the

Unknown 10:06
I didn't mean to make any oh, what's the ad dash? H, O, C, E,

Unknown 10:11
I also don't know. So I asked the chat GPT and the chat GBT say the meaning is not fixed, not like the fix, the fix the check in meetings.

Unknown 10:28
It is just,

Unknown 10:31
oh, if I have any question, or do you have any question, and we will communicating with through the email, yeah,

Unknown 10:43
not the fixed time or the fixed

Unknown 10:47
frequency, okay, yeah,

Unknown 10:52
all right, measure and assessments, okay?

Unknown 11:09
Well, this is a big help. I was thinking this was going to be most of the time that we spend during this call, but

Unknown 11:18
it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.

Unknown 11:25
Yeah, I mean, I think, I think these are worded really well.

Unknown 11:30
That's great.

Unknown 11:37
Okay, so I would need to sign here,

Unknown 11:41
and then I'll put my name how I put it up on this page. I'll just copy, paste it onto there.

Unknown 12:00
Okay,

Unknown 12:07
and then this page, we didn't to write anything.

Unknown 12:17
So at some point am I gonna have to write an essay? Uh huh,

Unknown 12:22
what point is that?

Unknown 12:25
I mean, that's all

Unknown 12:29
so the family scene for us is only to send this form for this page, for the page five. We didn't to need to write anything. Okay,

Unknown 12:41
yeah,

Unknown 12:47
it is for some final evolution or something. It is not for um, right now, us right now.

Unknown 12:56
Okay, so we just leave that blank.

Unknown 12:58
Yeah, we just leave it blank. Okay,

Unknown 13:01
so all I need to do is sign these pages. Yeah,

Unknown 13:06
we'll have you have to sign it to complete. And I have one. Okay, okay, so I think we can through the dog, sign this, this, eye,

Unknown 13:24
this, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Unknown 13:25
So what I'll do is I'll sign this and then send it right back to you. Is that right? Yeah, okay, that's all. That's what I'll

Unknown 13:36
do. Yeah. Is it that easy? Is this call already over, yeah?

Unknown 13:43
Oh, funny, funny. Now I can see you again. Uh huh, okay, well, that was a quick call. I think it's great

Unknown 13:51
you made that happen. Thanks for getting all that

Unknown 13:53
information together. Yeah, and by the way, I think I have a little update for the Shopify, the smart this, that type I've got a little bit yeah, and I have figured out, uh huh,

Unknown 14:07
I learned some stuff too that I wanted to tell you about. It won't take much time. Uh huh, what's your update? Um,

Unknown 14:15
I have figured out how to,

Unknown 14:19
how to, how to, how to complete the search and by the interchange field. So now, yeah, the customers can just search the interchange and under the page will show the products. And I even found two ways to achieve this, this function, yeah, okay, yeah, all right, and

Unknown 14:47
maybe that, maybe that's in line with what I'm about to tell you then. So last night, I was I was working late, and I was just working with chat GPT, trying to explore how these interchange numbers can be used within my Shopify pages or my products within Shopify so customers can, can, can find the products easier. And it is so it. It was so easy they chat GPT was able to take data that I've already gathered, put it in a format that can simply be copy pasted right into the interchange meta field. Yeah, that's already in Shopify Uh huh. And once you do that, I'm able to go into my website, uh huh. And if I was to copy paste any of those interchange numbers or what it is, it's, it's not just numbers that I put in, I actually let me, let me just share my screen. Yeah, okay, yeah, of course, you share my screen real. I'll share a different screen because I think we're done with this. I know to sign this, and I'll do that right off, right when we get out the phone, and then I'll send it to you, right? So let me stop sharing this one, and let me share another one that's to my right

Unknown 16:23
and it looks really pretty right now,

Unknown 16:27
but let me bring this up. Here we are, okay,

Unknown 16:35
and I'll just pick,

Unknown 16:38
pick this one.

Unknown 16:41
It's a control arm. I think it's one of my top sellers, just my back end of my Shopify. This is what my India team had put together. And it may not be the best quality, but it's better than what I've got, what I had anyways. So this is what I did was I copied, pasted this data in this field, and it's simply the exact same data that I have in my master sheet, just formatted so that it can easily be copy pasted into this field and and it is what, what this is is

Unknown 17:25
from my master sheet.

Unknown 17:32
Let's say what part number is this one? This is RK, 80942. Happens to be right here. Yeah. So this is my number four top seller. Yeah, all right, so I just go over to this column here to the right where I have there's the here, it's my column. P, sorry,

Unknown 18:00
you can see that a little bit better, yeah.

Unknown 18:08
Oh, that's okay. I can see it.

Unknown 18:10
So it's a it's a bunch of data, yeah, here, right, yeah, that's one car park with all those interchange numbers. I just took this data and I copy paste it into that interchange meta field. And yeah, it works, because if a customer is using any of these numbers, they can now copy, paste one of these numbers. I'll copy this one real quick, and I can go to

Unknown 18:43
my website,

Unknown 18:48
and I can use that search field up here, up top,

Unknown 18:52
type that in there,

Unknown 18:54
yeah, yeah. And it, it

Unknown 18:56
came up with the Yeah. So, I mean, it can't get much more simpler than that, but that's me doing it manually, right? Yeah. And I know that's not efficient, so the idea would be to do this in bulk, through a CSV file. Probably, yes,

Unknown 19:17
and, and I want to, I don't want to continue to do the manual work, because something's telling me in the back of my brain that the manual updates are different than the bulk updates, and I think it's quite possible that if you do a bulk update, yeah, it may override manual updates. Uh huh. I'm not quite sure if that's true. Do you know if that's true or not?

Unknown 19:49
I think maybe, well, yeah, maybe, well, be this situation.

Unknown 19:56
It might in. The reason why I'm thinking that in the back my head is because I've seen where in the past I have made some updates to particular products manually on my website, and then my India team has gone in and made their updates and and some of mine disappeared. Now I don't have that, because

Unknown 20:21
it's just, well, overwrite the all the data. Yeah, I think that's

Unknown 20:27
what happens. Yeah? So the idea is to do it one particular way, but not both, yeah, because I can work very hard and spend a lot of time doing all this manual update, but if it's just going to be erased at some point because of a bulk update, then I don't want to continue to do that. Yeah, yeah. So in this case, I was just playing around. My wife was wanting me to eat dinner. I was still up on the computer trying to figure this out, and I did my top four real quick, and I was where, where I was got my excitement was actually doing the test and and doing the search like what we just did, and it actually brought up the right part, which is the First my website's never been able to do that before, and it's just so funny that chat GPT is the one that helped me through

Unknown 21:27
that. Yeah, it's very

Unknown 21:31
helpful and and so I found it to be very helpful. So, so how is, from what you had explained,

Unknown 21:42
is my update related to what,

Unknown 21:46
what what your update was, telling what your update was or no.

Unknown 21:53
Sorry, I didn't get what you just say, No,

Unknown 21:57
you had explained some updates to me before, uh huh. And then I explained my update, uh huh. How are they related? Is my update related to what you were, what you had already?

Unknown 22:10
Yeah, I think our ways are related. And I just say two ways, and first way, it is very easy to achieve, but, but it is master to must, must be manually write the values, but the second, one, second ways it can achieve the

Unknown 22:38
a lot of update,

Unknown 22:41
yeah, and I will try this way how to achieve one time, and we just upload a CSV files or something, or something like that, And then we can update a lot of products at one time and didn't need manual, manually? Yeah, it can be achieved. Okay, yeah, okay,

Unknown 23:16
well, I think that's it, then, yeah, I want to get these, sign these forms signed, and get them back to you right away. I'll do that next, yeah,

Unknown 23:26
yeah. And I think we can through the dog, sign this, yeah, website,

Unknown 23:33
okay, yeah, all right.

Unknown 23:36
Then we'll go from there

Unknown 23:38
signing back to you, and

Unknown 23:42
then we can regroup later. Yeah, okay, thank you for your time. Thank you so much. You're welcome. I'll talk to you later,

Unknown 23:50
and I really appreciate

Unknown 23:53
Yeah, you're welcome. Thank you. I appreciate you.

Unknown 23:57
Okay, I'll talk to you later, yeah, okay, bye, bye,
